Step 1: Preheat Your Oven to 350 Degrees Fahrenheit

Step 2:In your smaller mixing bowl, combine your flour, baking soda, and salt. Whisk it together and put it to the side.

Step 3:In your larger mixing bowl, beat together with your electric mixer the granulated sugar and your softened butter until it is creamy. Then, once your mixture is light and creamy, add in your brown sugar and vanilla. Beat it all together until everything is combined.

Step 4:Add in the eggs one at a time to the butter, sugar, and vanilla mixture after it is all incorporated. Beat the mixture after each egg addition. Beat the mixture again once both eggs are mixed in. Beat this mixture until it is creamy.

Step 5:Once your dough is all mixed together, grab your baking sheet. You can either use a cooking spray or wax or parchment paper. If you use wax or parchment paper, get a piece and cover the bottom of your tray with it. If you are using cooking spray, just spray the bottom of your pan.

Step 6:Drop the cookie dough onto the cookie sheet by the tablespoon or 1/4 cup. Make sure they are at least 2-3 inches apart so that they do not merge together while baking.

Step 7:Cook the cookies for 9 to 11 minutes, or until golden brown. When the cookies are done take them out of the oven, off the tray and transfer them to the wire rack. Start your next batch with the leftover dough.

Step 8:Enjoy!!!!!
